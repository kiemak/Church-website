            As Christ's vicar, each bishop has the pastoral care of the <br> particular Church entrusted to him, <br>
            but at the same time he bears collegially with all his <br> brothers in the episcopacy the solicitude for <br>
            all the Churches Though each bishop is the lawful <br> pastor only of the portion of the flock entrusted to his
            <br>
            care, as a legitimate successor of the apostles he is, <br> by divine institution and precept, responsible with
            <br>
            the other bishops for the apostolic mission of the Church.
