            After one year of the mandatory Adult Catechism in 2016/2017, and upon reception of <br>
            respective Sacraments (Baptism, First Holy Communion, Confirmation), <br>
            the members came together to form St. Mother Teresa of Calcutta SCC. <br>
            This was heavily inspired by the spirit of togetherness that glued the <br>
            members to one another, <br>
            and the great need to carry it forward in their Sacramental lives. <br>
            With the insightful help and guidance of Deacon Samuel Warari Ndotono <br>
            (Now Fr. Samuel Warari Ndotono) <br>
            and Rev. Fr. Simon Peter Kamomoe <br> (Father-in-Charge HFMB), this huge feat became a reality.

        We are little flowers of Jesus, come let us follow Him friend! <br>
        Pontifical Missionary Childhood (P.M.C) is a wonderful and intimate following of Christ who is our friend as he
        said, <br>
        ‘’let the little children come to me’’ <br>
        And so I say let us follow Him courageously and joyfully. Jesus becomes our intimate friend in various <br>
        ways e.g Rosary prayer because He says, “where two or <br>
        three are gathered I am in their midst’’.

                The MYM (Missionary Youth Movement) group is a Christ centered, teenage church group <br>
                with the aim of serving the Lord in the teen ages (13 -19). So far, we have managed to <br>
                win about 60 teenagers coming for mass to join the group and fellowship, grow and learn <br>
                with each other, in Christ. Personally, I have grown in the group spiritually and mentally <br>
                especially from the last seminar where one of our visiting fathers spoke to us about growing <br>
                in Christ and the importance of the church in our growth of faith. The seminar was an eye opener <br>
                and helped not only those in attendance but also the group at large. I challenge all teenagers <br>
                and parents reading this, to bring their teens to our group.
