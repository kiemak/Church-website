                        The Holy Family minor basilica parish is the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Nairobi. The
                        current church as it stands was built <br>
                        in the 1940s and 1950s, with interruptions during the country’s liberation struggle for
                        independence. The story of the construction <br>
                        of the church goes back to 1899, where the once tiny rail workers camp was growing in leaps and
                        bounds. This impromptu settlement of <br>
                        the swampy plain (Nairobi), was an opportunity for the Catholic Church to cater for the
                        religious needs of the community. <br>

                        Under the administration of the Holy Ghost Fathers, in 1904, brother Josaphat, C.S.S.P (Holy
                        Ghost Missionary) <br>
                        was entrusted with the building of the church. With a sitting capacity of 300-400 people, it was
                        the first stone building in Nairobi. <br>

                        The structure of the current church was constructed by a British firm, Mowlem construction
                        International while the architectural <br>
                        work was designed by Mrs. Dorothy Hughes of Hughes & Polkinghorne Architects. The church as it
                        stands today has a sitting capacity of 3000 – 4000 people. <br>

                        The administration of the church was under the Holy Ghost Fathers from 1904-1991. The first
                        baptism was documented in 1906, <br>
                        two years after the establishment of the first church building. The first marriage was conducted
                        in 1908, while the first group of Christians was confirmed in 1923. <br>
                        Archbishop JJ McCarthy, (a Holy Ghost Missionary) was the first Archbishop of Archdiocese of
                        Nairobi.
